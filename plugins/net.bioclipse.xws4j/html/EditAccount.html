<h2>Edit a XMPP-account</h2>
Once you created your XMPP-account (see <a href="createAccount.html">Adding a XMPP-acount to Bioclipse</a> above), it is easy to change the settings. This is done in the user preferences; choose <b>Window &gt; Preferences</b> and then <b>Users</b> in the list to the left. Select the your user account in the list to the right and click on the button <b>Edit...</b> beneath the list with user accounts. You will now be asked for the password, type it in and click <b>OK</b>.After that you will see a dialog that is called &quot;Bioclipse Account Properties&quot; (See also the image below) that list with all the accounts connected to your user account, select your XMPP-account in the list to the left and then you may either edit the settings in the table to the right or by clicking on the button labeled &quot;Edit account...&quot; beneath the list with accounts.<br/>
If you want to know more about this dialog, please look at the chapiter &quot<a href="../../net.bioclipse.ui/html/usermanager/usingPrefs.html">Using Preferences&quot;</a> in the Bioclipse user manual.<br/><br/>
