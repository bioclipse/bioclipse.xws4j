To be able to login the an XMPP-service you need to add the information to your user account in Bioclipse. If you have not created an user account, yet then follow the instructions in the section &quot;<a href="../../net.bioclipse.ui/html/usermanager/accountWizardHelp.html">Creating a new user account</a>&quot; of Bioclipse user manual.<br/>
The information needed by the XMPP-service (as for all web-services that you might use in Bioclipse) is stored in a sub-account to your user account. To create this sub-account, choose <b>File &gt; New... &gt; General &gt; Account</b> and press <b>next</b>. If you have not logged in to your Bioclipse user account, you will be asked to do so. Write your user name and password, and then press <b>next</b> again. Now the wizard should look simular to the image below, choose XMPP in the drop-down menu at the top of the wizard.
